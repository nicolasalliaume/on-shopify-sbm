# Shopify SBM

[![Developed by ON Lab](http://on-lab.com/developed-by-on-lab.svg?v=3)](http://on-lab.com)

Shopify SBM is a tool that will speed up the dev process using Slate when following our adaptation of [Git Successful Branching Model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for Shopify.

We also love it because we don't have to remember to change the SLATE_THEME_ID and end up pushing code to a theme we're not supposed to. This adds an extra layer of security to our workflow.

# â“µ Installation

## Install using NPM
Run `npm install -g https://github.com/nicolasalliaume/on-shopify-sbm` to install globally.

If installing locally, use `$ ./node_modules/.bin/shopify-sbm` to run commands.

## Install from source code
Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/nicolasalliaume/on-shopify-sbm` and run `$ ./index.js`

# â“¶ Configure authentication to a Shopify store
In order to run the commands, you need to have a .env file with DOMAIN, KEY and PASSWORD variables pointing to a private app on your Shopify store either:
* in the same directory you're running the command from, or
* provide a path to the .env file using `--env <file>`.

For more information on creating a private app and getting those variables' values, see [this readme](https://github.com/nicolasalliaume/on-shopify-cli#-configure-authentication-to-a-shopify-store).


# Operations supported (_so far_)
Right now, the this tool supports:

## Setting the theme ID

Run `shopify-sbm set` to update the .env variable SLATE_THEME_ID to point to the theme that matches the curren gir branch you're on.

For example, if you're working on a branch called `feature/contact-page`, the tool will look up a theme called *feature/contact-page* or *... - feature/contact-page* and set SLATE_THEME_ID to the ID of that theme.

ðŸ¤“ #protip: Add `shopify-sbm set && ` to the _start_, _watch_ and _deploy_ scripts in your package.json file, before `slate-tools ...`. That way it will automatically point to the correct theme when you start your work.

```json
...
"scripts": {
    "start": "shopify-sbm set && slate-tools start",
    "watch": "shopify-sbm set && slate-tools start --skipFirstDeploy",
    "deploy": "shopify-sbm set && slate-tools build && slate-tools deploy",
    ...
},
...
```

## Creating a new branch/theme

Run `shopify-sbm branch <branch name>` to create a new git branch with the given name and also a new theme to track that branch.

For example, if you're about to start working on a new feature called _"newsletter modal"_, run `shopify-sbm branch feature/newsletter-modal` to create a new branch from `dev`, and a new theme called `feature/newsletter-modal` as a duplicate of the _dev_ theme.
